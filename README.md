# Joplin Plugin - URL Meta

This plugin will grab and fetch meta tags (title, description and image) from URLs found in your notes. It also supports clicking on a URL in the markdown-it panel and popping up information in a dialog with options to open/copy. It also supports a panel that will show all found URLs in the note with buttons to open/copy. This plugin can only fetch these tags from the desktop client, but can display details in the mobile version.
